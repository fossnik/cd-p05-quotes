        <div class="blockquote">
            <p>In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.</p>
            <p>“What are you doing?”, asked Minsky.</p>
            <p>“I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe” Sussman replied.</p>
            <p>“Why is the net wired randomly?”, asked Minsky.</p>
            <p>“I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play”, Sussman said.</p>
            <p>Minsky then shut his eyes.</p>
            <p>“Why do you close your eyes?”, Sussman asked his teacher.</p>
            <p>“So that the room will be empty.”</p>
            <p>At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.</p>
